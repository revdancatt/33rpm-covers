## About

After the minimal week was over (which included the 45rpm, 33.333rpm and 78rpm works) I created pieces to be given as "Air Drops" to owners of 33.333rpm. These are the album covers that are supposed to go over the 33.333rpm vinyls.

Based on the work of designer Peter Saville (Joy Division, New Order, OMD), these covers take the hash and using a colour code, encode the hash into the cover.
